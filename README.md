# StoreData-System
OOP
1. Design a checkout system (OOP) that checkout staff can use to register sales and create a receipt.
2. When the program is started, a text file is loaded with data and all objects are created. The following data must be stored on Product: productId; price; price type(per kilo/styck); product name.
3. When you run the system, it provides a meny 1 Ny kunder; 2 Avsluta.
4. When "1 Ny kunder" is selected, a new sale is started. The system can save the productID and count that entered in, and show the receipt(including current date and time, all the products that registered, and calculate total amount to pay).
5. Whe "PAY"is entered in the system, the receipt information is saved to a file. A file with a date as its name registers all the receipts that happened on this date.
6. It gives an error message when a product that sells "per styck" is registed with a float count.
